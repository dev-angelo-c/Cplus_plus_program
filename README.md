Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 was about displaying and counting data in lists. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel my code was organized particularly well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could have made the backup file and read file a single class rather than individual functions. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the syntax for maps a bit confusing because of how much effort goes into simply displaying a key value pair to standard out.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Definitely the menu creation and selection. I did not like the way I generated my menu in the last project but the way I did it this time 
was much better

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Because it was roughly structured in an Model View Controller style I feel that pattern makes the program readable but also particularly adaptable because 
the approach separates Views, Functionality, and Data neatly.
